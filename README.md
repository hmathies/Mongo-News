<h2>Mongo Public Radio</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mongo News is an application that scrapes NPR's website at npr.org. Users can read articles from the website and then post comments about them. </li>

  <li>I love NPR and was inspired by the wonderful news content that they provide their listeners with everyday! </li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Node.js-<p>This application uses the following npm packages: Express, Body-parser, Mongoose, Cheerio, Express-Handlebars, and Request.  To run this application on your local computer do: git clone, git init and npm i in the command line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>MongoDB- NoSQL document database </li>
  <li>Mongoose- a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment</li>
  <li>Express- web framework for node</li>
  <li>Body-parser- Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap- CSS framework</li>
  <li>Cheerio-  jQuery designed specifically for the server</li>
  <li>Request- supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.</li>
  <li>Express-Handlebars- view engine for Express</li>
</ul>


<h2>Future Development</h2>
<p>The application does not currently include images associated with articles and that will be added in future versions.  </p>
